3rd System Programming Assignment

Used: C++11 (Developed on Linux Ubuntu 16.04), used git for version control and valgrind for debugging purposes.

Contents:
- this readme
- previous assignment's files (bb, date, heap, ht, record, tree, date_format, quicksort, Pair, Triplette, PairArray, PidArray, TripleArray, StringArray .cpp & .h files, main_aggregator.cpp, main_worker.cpp/.h)

Use:
- While in each project subfolder, run "$make" to create the .o files and the executable
- execute "$make run" to execute (to see the parameters values and alter them, see the Makefile file)
- execute "$make val" to execute using valgrind (requires it to be installed: sudo apt-get install valgrind)
- execute "$make clean" to clean the working folder. (leaves log files intact)
